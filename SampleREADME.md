## Description
    If you create an open source project on GitHub, you should have a quality README detailing the app's purpose, how to use it, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to contribute to make sure other developers can use the project and contribute to its success. This is a Node.js application that generates README.md files dynamically based on the information provided about your project when running with the command line.
